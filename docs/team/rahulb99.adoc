== PROJECT: ePiggy

---

== Overview

ePiggy is a desktop application designed to inculcate good spending habits in students.
ePiggy hopes to make managing money much simpler for you with a simple interface and simple commands!
At the same time, ePiggy offers everything you need to cultivate good spending habits before entering the workforce,
from tracking expenses and managing budgets to setting goals! +

The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. +

*_ePiggy_* is a product of twin modules CS2101 and CS2103T. It was transformed from the
link:https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S2/addressbook-level4[AddressBook - Level 4] application.

== Summary of contributions

---

* *Major enhancements*: added *the ability to search and sort for expenses*
** What it does: +
 1. allows the user to search for his/her expenses by either it's `name`, `cost`, `date` and/or `tag` ! +
 2. allows the user to sort his/her expenses by either it's `name`, `cost` or `date` !
** Justification: These features improves the product significantly because: +
1. It becomes more convenient for the user to find a particular expenses or a set of expenses
to figure out where he/she has been spending.
2. It becomes more convenient for the user to sort the expenses according to his/her preferences.
For example, if the user wants to find out where he/she has been spending more, the user can sort it by cost.
** Highlights: These enhancements are two of the most user-friendly commands in ePiggy, mainly due to their need and adaptability. +
1. The search feature enhancement have been built on top of the existing functionality. Now it allows multiple keywords search to filter out the
expenses. This feature searches for similar words in case the user makes a typing error. Furthermore, it allows user to
enter a range for date and cost. This implementation was quite challenging as it required the complete modification of the existing command.
2. The sort feature enhancement was built from start to finish. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
This new feature greatly adds to the functionality of existing commands (that were modified from address-book level 4).

* *Minor enhancement*: Added reverse list command. Modified existing help and list commands. Refactored the codebase.

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Managed product releases on GitHub.
*** Set up the issue tracker, user stories, and assigned the milestones.
*** Tested for bugs for all features of `EPiggy`.

** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Made `date` an optional keyword while adding an expense.
   (so now, if the `date` keyword is missing, `date` takes the value of device's date). (Commit: https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/pull/135/commits/b974cc12cc700d751de34c80307267d26f5e455e[b974cc] )
*** Wrote base tests for any command related to `expense`, in addition to `FindCommandTest`, `SortCommandTest` and `ReverseListCommandTest`.
 (Pull requests https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/pull/135[#135], https://github.com[#00])
*** Modified the search engine by make it more powerful by searching for similar words in case user makes a typo, or even when user
types a part of the keyword he/she wishes to search for.
*** Modified the storage functionality. (Pull Request https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/pull/20[#20])

One major use of `reverseList` command is executing it after searching/sorting the expense list.
'reverseList` and `rl` are equivalent.

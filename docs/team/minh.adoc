== Introduction
=== About
// what specific project task is, what module it is for, whether it is an indiv or grp proj
*ePiggy* is a desktop application for managing personal finances. It allows users to track expenses and allowances,
manage budgets and saving goals. The app is designed specifically for students to encourage them to establish
good spending habits. +

*ePiggy* features a minimalist Graphical User Interface, and it interacts with users through a Command Line Interface.
Written in Java, it can be used on all major desktop operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.

=== Project Team

*ePiggy* was developed as a group project for the twin modules
_CS2101 - Effective Communication for Computing Professionals_
and _CS2103T - Software Engineering_. It was transformed from
the link:https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S2/addressbook-level4[AddressBook - Level 4] application.
My team consists of 5 members, including myself. +
I implemented the expense tracking features (adding, deleting and modifying expense records).

== Summary of contributions

=== Features implemented

I implemented the expense management features.

These features allow users to manage expenses by adding, modifying and deleting expenses.
It provides a panel in the User Interface for viewing the expenses.

These features provide the essential functionality for an expense tracker application.
The users have flexible control over the records, as they can modifying existing records and remove
them. With the clean expense list in the UI, they can view any past records easily.

As these are the essential features of the product, I was also responsible for designing the model that
forms the basis for other features to be implemented.
The implementation involved changes in all components of the system, requiring me to have
a thorough understanding of the whole codebase.

=== Other Contributions

* Project Management:
As I am the team leader, I am in charge of the approach and direction for our project.
This includes deciding how we go about morphing the product, and how we work collaboratively. +

* Undo / Redo: I am in charge of the Undo / Redo feature. Since the feature was already implemented
in AddressBook 4, my task was to help others integrate their features with Undo / Redo.
